"""
Every Problem should inherit from Problem class.
The rationale for using python class to define problems
as opposed to persistent data (JSON file, DB) is:
1. Some problems require the program to modify data structures in place,
    so you need code to validate its correctness.
2. For some problems, input/expected output may need customized serialization
    and deserialization code.
3. Sometimes the only way to validate a program is to call a correct solver
   and compare results.
