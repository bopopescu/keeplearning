# Lootcode #

## Visit online version [HERE](http://lootcode.sinaapp.com) ##

Lootcode is my implementation of an online judge (OJ) system, inspired by the very well-known **Leetcode** website among programmers. It is not supposed to be feature-complete, or even bug-free, and I have no intention to make it a public service. It is just my personal python project, when trying to solve the problems involved with submitting code to execute remotely on a server.

## Features ##

- Problem definition with a python Class, including problem metadata, test cases, solution validation code
- Only python code submission is supported
- A very simple sandbox to restrict exploit code
- TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) support
- 2 run modes - run submitted code inline or in another thread
- 5 trivial problems for demo purposes
- TBD: memory exceeded support

Feel free to fork the code if you are interested, also any comments/suggestions are [welcome](mailto:real-hacker@126.com).
